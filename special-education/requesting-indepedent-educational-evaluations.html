      <h1>Requesting Independent Educational Evaluations (IEE)</h1>
      <p class="meta">If you disagree with the school’s evaluation, you can request an <strong>Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE)</strong> by a qualified examiner not employed by the district. Here’s how it works for Alabama families.</p>
    </header>

    <!-- What is an IEE + DYK -->
    <section class="card card-two-col">
      <div>
        <h2>What is an IEE?</h2>
        <p>An IEE is a comprehensive evaluation conducted by an independent professional (psychologist, SLP, OT, etc.) who is <em>not</em> employed by the school district. Parents typically request an IEE when they believe the district’s evaluation is incomplete, inaccurate, or doesn’t reflect the student’s needs.</p>
        <h3>When parents request an IEE at public expense</h3>
        <p>Under federal special education law, if you disagree with a district evaluation, you can request an IEE <strong>at public expense</strong>. After your request, the district must, <em>without unnecessary delay</em>, either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>agree to fund the IEE under its criteria, or</li>
          <li>file for due process to defend its evaluation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="meta">“Public expense” means the district pays for the IEE or ensures it’s provided at no cost to you.</p>
      </div>
      <aside class="dyk">
        <h3>Did you know?</h3>
        <p>The school must <strong>consider</strong> the results of any IEE you share with them, whether you paid for it or the district did—though they don’t have to accept every recommendation.</p>
      </aside>
    </section>

    <!-- When to consider -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>When to Consider an IEE</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The evaluation seems too brief or misses areas of concern (e.g., dyslexia, ADHD, autism, language, motor, behavior).</li>
        <li>Scores don’t match what you or teachers observe day-to-day.</li>
        <li>Recommended services or accommodations seem out of step with needs.</li>
        <li>You want a second opinion from a specialist with deeper expertise.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- How to request -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>How to Request an IEE (Step-by-Step)</h2>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li><strong>Send a written request</strong> to the principal and special education director stating you disagree with the district’s evaluation and are requesting an IEE at public expense.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for the district’s IEE criteria</strong> (qualifications, cost caps, location limits, timelines). You do not have to explain your disagreement in detail, but you can share concerns if you want.</li>
        <li><strong>Wait for the district’s response.</strong> They must either agree to fund the IEE or file for due process to defend their evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose a qualified evaluator</strong> who meets district criteria. If no one local meets a restriction, ask for a criteria waiver with a short justification.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide consent and release</strong> so the evaluator can review records, speak with teachers, and observe if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Meet to review results</strong> once the IEE is complete. Request an IEP meeting to consider recommendations and update the plan as appropriate.</li>
      </ol>

        <summary>Sample IEE Request Email</summary>
        <pre>Subject: Request for Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE) at Public Expense

Dear [Principal Name] and [Special Education Director Name],

I am writing to inform you that I disagree with the district’s evaluation of my child, [Student Name], [DOB], at [School]. I am requesting an Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE) at public expense.

Please send me the district’s criteria for IEEs (evaluator qualifications, cost parameters, geographic/location limits, and timelines), as well as the process for approving evaluators and payment.

I look forward to your response. I am available at [phone/email].

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Date]</pre>

    <!-- Who pays / criteria -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Who Pays? What Are the Rules?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>District-funded IEE:</strong> If the district agrees, they typically pay the provider directly or reimburse you. They may give you a list of evaluators—but you can request anyone who meets their criteria.</li>
        <li><strong>Due process option:</strong> If the district refuses to fund, it must file for due process <em>without unnecessary delay</em> to show its evaluation was appropriate.</li>
        <li><strong>Parent-funded IEE:</strong> You can always obtain a private evaluation at your own expense; the district must still <em>consider</em> the results.</li>
        <li><strong>Reasonable criteria:</strong> District criteria (cost caps, distance) must be reasonable and not effectively block your right to an IEE.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Choosing evaluator -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Choosing an Evaluator</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Look for specialty experience (e.g., dyslexia assessment, autism diagnostics, bilingual evaluation).</li>
        <li>Ask about school observations, classroom strategies, and practical recommendations—not just test scores.</li>
        <li>Confirm they meet district criteria; request a waiver if necessary (e.g., nearest specialist is outside the radius).</li>
        <li>Ask for a written report and a parent-friendly summary page you can share with teachers.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- After the IEE -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>After the IEE: Using the Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Request an IEP meeting to review the IEE and update goals, services, and accommodations.</li>
        <li>Ask the evaluator to attend (district-funded IEEs often include participation).</li>
        <li>Translate recommendations into specific, measurable supports (service minutes, accommodation wording, progress monitoring).</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="tip" style="margin-top:10px;">
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p>Bring a one-page “action list” to the meeting: which goals/services you want added or changed and the exact wording for key accommodations.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- FAQs -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>IEE FAQs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do I have to explain why I disagree?</strong> No. You may, but the district can’t require detailed reasons to process your request.</li>
        <li><strong>Can the district set a cost cap?</strong> Yes, but it must be reasonable for your area and needs; ask how they set it and request a waiver if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Can I pick anyone?</strong> You can propose any qualified evaluator meeting district criteria; you aren’t limited to the district’s list.</li>
        <li><strong>How fast must they respond?</strong> The law says “without unnecessary delay.” If it’s dragging on, ask for timelines in writing or consider dispute resolution options.</li>
