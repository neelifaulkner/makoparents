Re: Request for Special Education Evaluation for [Child’s Full Name], [DOB]

Dear [Principal’s Name],

I am formally requesting a comprehensive special education evaluation for my child, [Child’s Full Name], who is in [grade] at [school]. I am concerned that my child may have a disability that is impacting [his/her/their] ability to make adequate progress in school.

Please consider this letter my written consent for evaluation. I request that the evaluation cover all areas of suspected disability, including but not limited to [list areas: reading, writing, math, speech/language, behavior, attention, etc.].

Please provide me with a copy of my rights under IDEA and let me know the timeline for the evaluation process. I request a written response to this letter.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Printed Name]
